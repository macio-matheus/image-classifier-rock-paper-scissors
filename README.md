## Image Classifier Rock, Paper e Scissors dataset

By: MÃ¡cio Matheus Santos de Arruda

Multilabel classification using convolutional networks. This project uses the dataset Rock, Paper e Scissors, a famous database for computer vision applications.

------

### The dataset

Rock Paper Scissors contains images from a variety of different hands,  from different races, ages and genders, posed into Rock / Paper or Scissors and labelled as such.

### Train / Validation Split

As in the image, for the validation set that compose the metrics measured in the training, a percentage of 33% of the data in the training images folder is defined in the Keras generator by the parameter validation_split.

Note: The Live Test is performed with a set of images that do not participate in the training.

### Test live

Prediction performed on images that were outside the training set and validation. The crabs were intentionally pointed in circle format to cause error in the model:
